# azure-ai-foundry-agent

## Overview

The `azure-ai-foundry-agent` is a Python-based Azure Function application designed to interact with
Azure AI Projects. It provides an HTTP-triggered endpoint for processing user messages and
generating responses using AI agents.

This application is built to:

1. Handle user requests with message input.
2. Retrieve or create an AI agent thread.
3. Interact with the Azure AI Project API to process messages.
4. Generate responses based on AI agent capabilities.

## Features

- **HTTP Trigger**: Provides an anonymous endpoint `/agent_httptrigger` to accept user inputs.
- **Integration with Azure AI Projects**: Uses the `azure-ai-projects` library to manage AI agents,
  threads, and messages.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error checking and logging to ensure smooth operation.
